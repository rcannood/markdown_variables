subtitle: Include markdown content as Quarto variables
---

## Introduction

Using [Quarto variables](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/variables.html) makes a lot of sense when dealing with customizations. Variables can include markdown, but in our experience it's limited to hyperlinks and some basic formatting.

This has been tested with Quarto v1.3.310.

The `README.md` in this repo is generated using the following command:

```sh
quarto render -o README.md -t gfm
```

## Examples

The following are all fetched from `_variables.yml` that is available in this repository.

Below, we use the `{{{< var ... >}}}` syntax to include these variables in the text:

### Simple text

A simple string variable:

:::{.bg-light}
{{< var text >}}
:::

### Bold text

:::{.bg-light}
{{< var bold >}}
:::

### Emphasis

:::{.bg-light}
{{< var emph >}}
:::

### Bullets

A bullet list:

:::{.bg-light}
{{< var bullets >}}
:::

### Multiline

:::{.bg-light}
{{< var multiline >}}
:::

### Code

This is interesting, the multiline fenced code block is not rendered as it should, although syntax highlighting is applied depending on the markdown variant:

:::{.bg-dark}
{{< var code >}}
:::

### Title

:::{.bg-light}
{{< var title >}}
:::

### Title in multiline string

:::{.bg-light}
{{< var other_title >}}
:::
